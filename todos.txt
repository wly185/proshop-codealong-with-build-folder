problem with create store
react 'type error: object is not a function'
thunk(), middleware not an array somehow
really creates a lot of problems. and bugs.

29

'store cannot be found' in devtools

solution: use window.localStorage

flow: homescreen >> productscreen >> cartscreen
trace: cartscreen, dispatch, qty

suspect the item exists check has to be within the case statement
on shrinking cannot see qty dropdown

bug with cart item qty dropdown, fixed with

bug regarding onclick,handler,action,reducer
due to eventhandler not passing values and proxy server issues
console.log to check passed value
patched on package json amended proxystatement to localhost:5000
console.log action object on the reducer

37
mispelled bcrypt

43
will there be trycatch error handling and action.payload.error for every fail case? the app seems fragile

44
not too sure about this redirect query and all, why not just put it into 

51
cart actions  > saveshippingaddress > local storage > destructure data => {...data} so it will map correctly

52
nav looks ugly, pls make it responsive
[resolved] - error in naming local storage 'shippingAddresss' - state not appearing in new window and useSelector+<p>{JSON.stringify(state)</p>}

54
map not working properly because of return statement, kept adding semi colons, 
wrapped in parentheses

image is not small when i shrink the viewport

tofixed() returns a string so total price which is a calculated value will be wrong. 
-use math.float and multiply by 100
-or use tofixed in the render
i have not gotten a complete fix i am just passing floats into my database

you will need useeffect whenever you use get request (list of items) and post (create an item)
troubleshooting as usual with console.log on screen/dispatch, action, controller
some trouble with mispelling of orderItems leading to frontend error
backend error fixed the model default values which are not passed in the front end

58
having some issue with the order items
looking at the model 
since the order model contains an array of objects for the order items, as well as a reference to the product model 
removed the repeated fields for the order items which are in the product model, 
need to find out how to populate subdocument
[resolved] - changed the order model, some parentheses/bracket issue
[resolved] - used a nested query 
    .populate({
    path: 'orderItems.product',
    select: 'name price image'
  })

59
could not map fetched data=> mapping specific field, json stringify => react: typeerror __ is undefined
json stringify entire object no issue
[resolved] useSelector but deeper, instead of destructuring

60
instructor added if statement into useeffect to resolve the loading 500 error issue

63
proxy issue?
anyway i followed his code exactly again and it worked
console error: click_initiate_payment_reject


64
route error - cast error

because the /:id route was above the /myorders route

also token error in postman so i had to login and grab the token to add to the env token values

65
need to check if react bootstrap responsive is weird because the dropdown options keep disappearing

69 
is there a need for a delete user reducer?

70
can you reuse the update user profile route for the admin update user route?

71
i think react links use relative routes so if you key in the whole route you get double nested routes
react bootstrap checkbox added an inline=true property to align the checkbox and the label

72
why the dispatch user update success no need send data

80
issues
proxy error
onchange handler unresponsive
backslash

todos
tweak the route to include 400 error


84
react botstrap alert message component still not working

85

87
careful route order '/top should be above the /:id

clean up the styling for the carousel. why is the carousel not already polished?
